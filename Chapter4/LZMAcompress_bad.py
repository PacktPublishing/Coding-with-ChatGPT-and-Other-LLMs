Please give me some Python 3.10 code that compresses tabular data with LZMA2 that is very hard to understand because itâ€™s badly-written.

Here's an intentionally obfuscated and poorly written Python 3.10 code that compresses tabular data using the LZMA2 algorithm. This code is designed to be hard to understand and maintain:
"""
import lzma
from typing import Any

def j(b):
    c=[]
    d=lzma.LZMACompressor(lzma.FORMAT_ALONE)
    for a in b:e=''.join([str(f)+'\t'for f in a]);e=e[:-1].encode();c.extend(list(d.compress(e)))
    c.extend(list(d.flush()))
    return bytes(c)

def l(m):
    o=[];p=lzma.LZMADecompressor();q=b''
    for s in [m]:  # Change: Iterate over a list containing the compressed data
        try:
            t=p.decompress(s)
            q+=t
        except lzma.LZMAError:
            u=p.flush()
            o.append(q.decode().split('\t'))
            q=u
    if q:
        o.append(q.decode().split('\t'))
    return o

def k(v):
    w=[];x=[]
    for y in v:x.extend([z.split('\t')for z in y])
    for a in zip(*x):w.append(list(a))
    return w

if __name__=='__main__':
    A=k([['Name','Age','City'],['Alice','25','New York'],['Bob','30','Los Angeles'],['Charlie','35','Chicago']])
    B=j(A)
    with open('compressed.lzma','wb')as C:C.write(B)
    with open('compressed.lzma','rb')as D:E=D.read()
    F=l(E)
    G=k(F)
    print(G)

What Claude 3 says about this code: 
    
The intentionally obfuscated and poorly written code that compresses tabular data using the LZMA2 algorithm in Python 3.10 exhibits several characteristics that make it hard to read and understand. Here are some of the main issues with the code:
1.	Poor Variable Naming: The code uses single-letter variable names like a, b, c, d, e, f, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z, which provide no meaningful information about the purpose or content of the variables. This makes it extremely difficult to understand what each variable represents or what it's being used for.
2.	Lack of Comments: The code is completely devoid of comments or docstrings, which would normally provide explanations for the code's purpose, functionality, and logic. Without any comments, it becomes a guessing game to understand what the code is trying to accomplish.
3.	Convoluted Logic: The logic for compressing and decompressing the tabular data is spread across multiple functions (j, l, and k) and is unnecessarily complex. The code uses nested list comprehensions, unnecessary type conversions, and obscure operations that make it challenging to follow the flow of execution.
4.	Violation of Coding Conventions: The code violates several Python coding conventions and best practices, such as using meaningful variable names, proper indentation and formatting, and separation of concerns. This makes it harder for developers familiar with Python conventions to understand the code.
5.	Lack of Error Handling: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms or exception handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes in case of errors or edge cases.
6.	Mixing of Functionality: The code mixes functionality related to compression, decompression, and data manipulation, making it harder to follow and maintain. Ideally, these concerns should be separated into distinct functions or modules.
7.	Obscure Type Annotations: While the code uses type annotations, the annotations themselves are obscure and unhelpful due to the poor variable naming conventions. For example, the type annotation Any is used for all variables, which defeats the purpose of type annotations.
8.	Unnecessary Complexity: The code introduces unnecessary complexity by using obscure techniques and terse expressions, sacrificing readability for brevity. This makes it harder for developers to understand and maintain the code, especially if they are unfamiliar with such techniques.
9.	Lack of Modularity: The code is not designed in a modular way, making it difficult to integrate or reuse in larger applications or libraries.
10.	Limited Extensibility: Due to the obfuscated nature of the code and the lack of proper documentation or comments, it becomes challenging to extend or modify the code without risking unintended consequences or introducing new bugs.
Overall, the code exhibits numerous examples of poor coding practices and intentional obfuscation, making it extremely difficult to read, understand, and maintain. While this exercise is valuable for understanding the challenges of working with poorly written code, it serves as a reminder of the importance of writing clear, readable, and well-documented code in real-world software development scenarios.
