/*Example (Maven): 

This is XML code.
This XML code snippet is a configuration for the Maven PMD plugin. Maven is a popular build automation tool for Java projects, and plugins extend its functionality.

Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

<plugin> tag: This tag defines a plugin configuration.
<groupId>, <artifactId>, and <version> tags: These tags specify the group ID, artifact ID, and version of the PMD plugin, respectively. This information is used by Maven to locate and download the plugin.
<configuration> tag: This tag contains the specific configuration settings for the PMD plugin. In this case, the configuration is empty, which means the plugin will use its default settings.
The PMD plugin is a static code analysis tool that helps identify potential bugs, code smells, and other issues in Java code. By configuring this plugin in your Maven project, you can automatically run code analysis during your build process and improve the quality of your code.
